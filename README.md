# Employee Management System

## 1. Open your project folder

First open your terminal and move into the project folder

cd /path/to/your/project

## 2. Make the file
Since I created a makefile to compile just do

```bash
make
```
## 3. Run the file
This compiles employee_management.c and creates employee_management. Then run

```bash
./employee_management
```
## 4. Using the executable
You will see a menu popup.

To use it
- Type a number (1-4) and press **Enter**
- The program will do that action
- After each action you will see

```bash
Press enter to continue...
```
Then you can press enter to go back to the main menu

If you want to delete the compiled program and start fresh run

```bash
make clean
```

This will remove the employee_management executable but not delete any data files created.
